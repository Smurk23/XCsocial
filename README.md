In this challenge I was able to use a mongoDB server and demo POST, PUT, UPDATE, AND DELETE routes. I showed how someone could get all user, update a user, get a user by id, and even delete that user. These same CRUD routes applied to the thoughts of these users. I was also able to add a delete and add route for users to have friends + reactions to thoughts of other users.
